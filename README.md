# Library-odin-project

Few weeks ago i found Odin project as best learning platform for me, i took edx harvard cs50, went to the bunch of tutorials on youtube, learned on scrimba through interactive tutorials, even tried some programming games, but nothing was so good as odin project

Library project in javascript

It took me few hours and i even gave up at some point with perfecting it, it is first commit on which i gave up, but then after building web tic tac toe game i returned to remake this better, althrough there is plenty free space for improvement, but for little practice of objects i think is this enough
